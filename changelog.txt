1.4.24 (upcoming):
- Added a new config option ('dontSendNBT') which contains a set of registry names for blocks that don't want their NBT data to be sent from client to server. This is to avoid network packets becoming too large for blocks that have huge itemstacks as a result of 'picking' them

1.4.23:
- Compatible with the latest version of McJtyLib (for big power api)
- Fixed a bug where the one probe would show if a stone block contains a silverfish
- Added the word ‘level’ to the TOP info when a block cannot be harvested to hopefully lessen confusion with this
